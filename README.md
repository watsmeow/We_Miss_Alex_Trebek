## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Uses the basic front end stack and an API to create a fun game in tribute of the late, great, Alex Trebek. 

## Lessons Learned:

This project was great for experimenting with using JavaScript to insert elements into the DOM rather than relying on extensive HTML. Possible improvements include: 
- making the code more object oriented
- cleaner response validation
- fancier css
